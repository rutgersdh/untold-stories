Seabrook Farms located in Bridgeton, NJ became a home to a number of people throughout the African Diaspora during the 1940s-50s. In my estimation, there were various kinds of workers that brought the diaspora to Seabrook. There were migrant workers seeking refuge that found a home and a job at Seabrook. Migrant workers came from not just the South during the Great Migration, but also workers from the West Indies. Some workers from the West Indies were also government-sanctioned workers. Another form of workers was considered to be seasonal workers, where workers would come to the farm only during busy seasons. However, the most unique form of worker that I have come across is student workers. Several stories have noted a time at Seabrook Farms when approximately 500 young college women came to Seabrook Farms as workers.

These 500 young black women attended a variety of Southern Universities, many of them being Historically Black Colleges. The workers varied in class from sophomores to recent graduates. Some universities include but are not limited to Shaw University, Morris Brown College, and Spellman College. These workers specialized in processing the vegetables, which happened to be round-the-clock operations. These workers worked for 6 and a half cents per hour, which calculates to $5 for an 8-hour day. While not working the girls were housed together in Hoover Village Annex. Even with a shortage of labor and an intense need for workers we still see a sense of segregation and racism at Seabrook. In fact, CF Seabrook himself in a private letter to his lawyer circa 1943 stated:

>I have no prejudice against negro labor, and have always used negroes on the farm. I like them very much for farm and field work. I do not believe,however, (speaking now of the women) that they are as good at factory work as white women, and I know they work better and are much happier outside in the fields and in the sunshine. Besides, the class of trade that purchases quick frozen foods is very particular about the conditions under which it is handled and produced.[^1]

Regardless of the need for workers, CF felt that these women would be better off working in the fields because he believed white women would do the work better. Not to mention the class of trade was "particular" about how the foods were handled in other words not wanting the black women to touch and/or be involved with the packaging of frozen foods. Overall, the work of these hundreds of women was important to the packaging process for Seabrook farms.
