As mentioned previously Black workers were fortunate to be at Seabrook as it was a better alternative than the options they left. However, this does not mean they did not face issues while at Seabrook. Although fortunate to have housing arrangements, they had the worst housing villages and received the lowest pay, etc., etc. Through it all there were people advocating for better situations. Two individuals that fit this description, Wiley Bowman and Ogden Jack Dickerson, both of which were union stewards for Local 56, a Seabrook Union for Butcher and Meat Cutters, that advocated for contract negotiations. Both were well-respected leaders within the union, however, neither of them worked within the frozen food plants section. According to Seabrook Policy, Black workers were very rarely offered that position. Instead, Bowman worked in the canning plant, and Dickerson was a mechanic for farm vehicles and equipment. In 1957, Bowman was a union representative and argued for wage changes along with the Fair Labor and Changes Act. Bowman's testimony was provided to Congress. During his testimonial, Bowman stated he was the sole breadwinner of his large family, made $1.27 an hour, and worked 13 hours a day seven days a week. Bowman was married and had 6 children who were between the ages of one and nine years old at this time. Also at this time, many of the workers were being denied overtime pay even if they were working more than the intended 40-hour work weeks. Bowmans' account of the situation emphasizes just how little these hard workers were being valued at this time. Nevertheless, they persevered and continued to be of help Bowman even states in his testimonial “I don’t mind working hard. Thirteen-hour days seven days a week is tough, but I’ll work it if necessary. But I think family ought to have a decent living then.”. Its through leaders like Bowman and Dickerson that we find true value in community and unity. Without their leadership and persistence, there would be no written accounts today of the struggles they went through.
