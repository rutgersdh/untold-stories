I had the pleasure to sit down and interview with both Gloria Kates and Betty Brown Pitts, first cousins, who were born and raised at Seabrook Farms. It was through this discussion I truly got a sense of what Seabrook was like for African Americans who lived here. Orchard Center was one of the housing villages on the farm that was designated for Black workers. The farm did provide housing to its workers, however, these villages of houses were broken up by race. It is to be noted that other races at Seabrook were there for Federal purposes, for example, Japanese Americans who were released from internment were placed there as an agreement regarding their citizenship. In instances like this, they received government-funded housing in a separate village. Talking to Gloria, and Betty it was concluded the housing put aside for the Black workers, especially the migrant workers that weren't sanctioned there by the government received the worst of the housing. For example, using out houses for bathrooms whereas the other villages had bathrooms within the house themselves.

In my sit down with Gloria and Betty, my primary focus was getting their personal experiences as far as their upbringing and seeing if they experienced racism. As they grew up on a farm full of multiple races during the 1950s I was curious to know was it truly a cultural melting pot like suggested or were there hidden accounts of racism and unfair treatment. Although across the country racism was very prevalent and known at Seabrook things were a little different things were inconspicuous. For example, the children at Seabrook did attend integrated schools even though other schools in the area were segregated. Seabrook, although a farm,  was also recognized for having this community aspect through sports teams as well as scouts and such. In discussing the sports teams it was noted they did feature multiple races, but not many members were black. One thing I found interesting in particular was the stories of the scouts. Gloria and Betty vividly remember not participating in Girl Scouts and not being invited to the meetings even though a troop was located at the farm. As a former Girl Scout myself being invited is how I became involved. Why were they not invited? Questions like these do arise and put it back into perspective that, yes, things were different at Seabrook but some things did remain the same.
